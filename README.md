Unscramble App
===================================

This project is my solution code for the "Android Basics in Kotlin - Architecture Components" 
pathway. And it implements Android Jetpack Architecture components.

Game Overview
-------------

The Unscramble app is a single player word scrambler game. The app displays one scrambled word at 
a time, and the player has to guess the word using all the letters from the scrambled word. The 
player scores points if the word is correct, otherwise the player can try any number of times. The 
app also has an option to skip the current word. In the left top corner, the app displays the 
word count, which is the number of words played in this current game. There are 10 words per game.

Used in the [Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-kotlin-unit-3-pathway-3) course.


Accessibility 
-------------

* If the user has the "Talkback" feature enabled while playing "Unscramble", the app will load 
  the scrambled word and spell one letter at a time (instead of trying to read it as a regular word)
